# Fan Control

A simple program to control the speed of a 4-pin PWM fan using an Arduino Uno (though this code should be easily portable to other platforms too). Currently it does this by reading off of a potentiometer, but in future I plan to add the ability to use a temperature sensor to hold the space at a pre-defined temperature. Many thanks to [Terry Myers](https://github.com/terryjmyers/) for the [PWM library](https://github.com/terryjmyers/PWM) I used.

My flatmates and I (shout out to Salah and Naomi <3) bought a new cabinet to go under our TV and hold all our games, our media PC, Wii, etc. The problem is putting the computer and Wii in an enclosed space is that the heat they generate has nowhere to go. A big room has a large enough heat capacity to simply dump the hot air into, but the space inside a cabinet does not. So my solution is to just put a PC case fan through the back of the cabinet to draw hot air out into the surrounding room and draw in cool air through the hole that the cables with run through.
